# Warning:
Envuso is currently a WIP. I'm currently resolving a couple of issues and getting everything ready. Docs are incomplete and I'm often pushing updates. Wait a week or so and it should be ready to use.


## Envuso Socket Client
Envuso has out of the box websocket support, this frontend socket client will make your life a little easier to get started and using it.
It features JWT authentication, channel subscriptions(similar to rooms in socket.io) and "global events".
